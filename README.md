# DB-Module-1 Geting to know your data

In this assignment you will install tools to help you query a sql database. We'll be using 
an extension in Visual Studio Code to run queries.  Follow instruction in the [SETUP.md](https://github.com/rebeccapeltz/DB-Module-1/blob/master/SETUP.md) to get
your environment setup and make sure you can run a query.

Use the contents in [LESSON-1.md](https://github.com/rebeccapeltz/DB-Module-1/blob/master/LESSON-1.md) to help you familiarize yourself with the SQL syntax that will help you understand your data and answer questions about it.

Answer questions directly in the [RESULTS.md](https://github.com/rebeccapeltz/DB-Module-1/blob/master/RESULTS.md) file and push to github.
When you are asked to provide a SQL query paste it in with the markdown triple-tick marks so that it will display clearly as code.

Post the github link that contains this completed results file to Canvas.
